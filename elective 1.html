    <h2>Brief Explanation</h2>
    <p>
      Tidal power plants harness energy from the rise and fall of ocean tides, which are driven by the moon and sun. 
      Water is stored in a tidal basin during high tide and released through turbines when the tide recedes. 
      The turbines drive generators to produce electricity. A power conditioning system ensures the voltage and frequency 
      are stable before sending it through distribution lines to the village. Tidal energy is renewable, predictable, 
      and environmentally friendly. For coastal villages, it provides reliable electricity for homes, fisheries, 
      irrigation, and community services, making it a sustainable energy solution.

    Source of Energy for a Tidal Power Plant
  </h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px; color:#333; line-height:1.8; font-family:'Roboto', sans-serif; margin-top:10px; margin-left:20px; margin-bottom:0;">
    The primary source of energy in a tidal power plant is the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the Earth, 
    which causes the rise and fall of ocean tides. The movement of water during high and low tides creates a predictable 
    flow of kinetic and potential energy. In a coastal village setup, this tidal energy is captured by constructing a 
    tidal basin or estuary. During high tide, water is stored in the basin, creating a difference in water levels 
    (head) between the sea and basin. When the tide recedes, water flows through turbines, converting the stored potential 
    energy into mechanical energy. This natural, renewable source is predictable, reliable, and environmentally friendly, 
    making it ideal for providing decentralized electricity to small coastal communities.

  <h1>üåä Conversion Process in a Tidal Power Plant (for a Coastal Village)</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ Energy Source: Tidal Movement</h2>
    <p>The process begins with the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, which causes rise and fall of sea levels ‚Äî the tides.</p>
    <p>Coastal villages located near estuaries or narrow inlets experience noticeable tidal differences (tidal range).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ Harnessing the Tidal Energy</h2>
    <p>There are two main ways to capture tidal energy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tidal Barrage / Lagoon:</strong> A barrier (dam-like structure) traps water during high tide and releases it through turbines during low tide.</li>
      <li><strong>Tidal Stream Turbines:</strong> Turbines are placed underwater in strong tidal currents ‚Äî similar to wind turbines ‚Äî to extract kinetic energy directly from flowing water.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3Ô∏è‚É£ Conversion of Mechanical Energy</h2>
    <p>As water flows through the turbine blades, the kinetic or potential energy of moving water is converted into rotational mechanical energy.</p>
    <p>The turbine shaft is connected to a generator. The moving turbine turns the generator rotor, creating <strong>electromagnetic induction</strong> ‚Äî the physical basis for electricity generation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4Ô∏è‚É£ Conversion to Electrical Energy</h2>
    <p>Inside the generator, coils of wire rotate through a magnetic field, producing alternating current (AC) electricity.</p>
    <p>This raw power is sent to the <strong>powerhouse switchyard</strong> where it‚Äôs controlled and measured.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5Ô∏è‚É£ Voltage Regulation and Transmission</h2>
    <p>The electricity produced (typically at <strong>400‚Äì690 V</strong>) is stepped up or down using a transformer, depending on the village‚Äôs needs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step-up transformer ‚Üí</strong> if connected to regional grid (11 kV or 33 kV).</li>
      <li><strong>Step-down transformer ‚Üí</strong> if powering local microgrids or storage systems.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6Ô∏è‚É£ Energy Storage and Utilization</h2>
    <p>To balance generation with demand, a <strong>Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)</strong> can store excess power during high tides and supply it at low tide or at night.</p>
    <p>The generated electricity is then used for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Street lighting</li>
      <li>Water pumps</li>
      <li>Cold storage for fishers</li>
      <li>Community centers and schools</li>
      <li>Home electricity supply</li>
    </ul>
