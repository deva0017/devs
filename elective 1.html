  <!-- Brief Explanation Section -->
  <section id="tidal-brief">
    <h2>Brief Explanation</h2>
    <p>
      Tidal power plants harness energy from the rise and fall of ocean tides, which are driven by the moon and sun. 
      Water is stored in a tidal basin during high tide and released through turbines when the tide recedes. 
      The turbines drive generators to produce electricity. A power conditioning system ensures the voltage and frequency 
      are stable before sending it through distribution lines to the village. Tidal energy is renewable, predictable, 
      and environmentally friendly. For coastal villages, it provides reliable electricity for homes, fisheries, 
      irrigation, and community services, making it a sustainable energy solution.

    <h2>Source of Energy for a Tidal Power Plant</h2>
    <p>
      The primary source of energy in a tidal power plant is the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the Earth, 
      which causes the rise and fall of ocean tides. The movement of water during high and low tides creates a predictable 
      flow of kinetic and potential energy. In a coastal village setup, this tidal energy is captured by constructing a 
      tidal basin or estuary. During high tide, water is stored in the basin, creating a difference in water levels 
      (head) between the sea and basin. When the tide recedes, water flows through turbines, converting the stored potential 
      energy into mechanical energy. This natural, renewable source is predictable, reliable, and environmentally friendly, 
      making it ideal for providing decentralized electricity to small coastal communities.
